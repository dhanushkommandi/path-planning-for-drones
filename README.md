# Drone-based Smart Farming System 🌾🚁

This project presents an intelligent drone system for precision agriculture, where sensor data and reinforcement learning are combined to optimize field monitoring and resource management.

## 🔍 Overview

The system integrates:
- **Sensor nodes** that monitor environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
- A **drone** trained using **Reinforcement Learning (PPO algorithm)** to perform efficient path planning and data collection.
- Real-time data visualization and smart decision-making to support modern, data-driven farming practices.

## 🧠 Core Technologies

- **Reinforcement Learning** (Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO)
- **Drone automation & control**
- **Data visualization tools**
- **Python** and supporting frameworks/libraries

## 🧱 System Architecture

- Sensor nodes deployed across the field collect data.
- Drone receives coordinates and uses PPO to determine optimal path.
- Deployment and sequence diagrams detail how data flows through the system.
